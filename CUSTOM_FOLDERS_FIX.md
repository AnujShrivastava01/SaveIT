# Custom Folders Fix - Database Persistence

## Problem Description

The original SaveIT application had a critical issue where custom folders created by users were getting deleted automatically after some time. This happened because:

1. **Custom folders were only stored in localStorage** - They were not persisted to the database
2. **No database table for folders** - Only the saved items had a database table, but folder definitions were lost
3. **Items persisted but folders didn't** - When users recreated folders with the same names, their items would reappear because the items were stored with category names, but the folder definitions themselves were lost

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes

Created a new `custom_folders` table in Supabase:

```sql
CREATE TABLE custom_folders (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    icon TEXT DEFAULT 'Folder',
    color TEXT DEFAULT 'bg-gray-500',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(user_id, name)
);
```

### 2. Backend Functions

Added comprehensive database functions in `src/services/database.ts`:

- `createCustomFolder()` - Create new custom folders
- `getUserCustomFolders()` - Retrieve user's custom folders
- `updateCustomFolder()` - Update folder properties
- `deleteCustomFolder()` - Delete custom folders

### 3. Frontend Integration

Updated the `useDatabase` hook to include custom folder management:

- Added `customFolders` state
- Added `loadCustomFolders()` function
- Added `addCustomFolder()`, `updateCustomFolder()`, `deleteCustomFolder()` functions
- Integrated with the main UI components

### 4. UI Enhancements

Updated `src/pages/Index_new.tsx` to:

- Display both default categories and custom folders
- Add "Add Folder" button and dialog
- Show delete buttons for custom folders only
- Include confirmation dialog for folder deletion
- Update category selection to include custom folders

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Execute the SQL migration in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Run the contents of add-custom-folders-migration.sql
```

### Step 2: Update Application Code

The following files have been updated:

1. `src/utils/supabase.ts` - Added CustomFolder type and table reference
2. `src/services/database.ts` - Added custom folder CRUD functions
3. `src/hooks/useDatabase.ts` - Added custom folder state management
4. `src/pages/Index_new.tsx` - Updated UI to use database-backed folders

### Step 3: Test the Implementation

1. Create a new custom folder using the "Add Folder" button
2. Add items to the custom folder
3. Refresh the page - the folder should persist
4. Try deleting the folder - it should be removed permanently
5. Test on different browsers/devices - folders should sync

## Key Features

### Persistent Storage
- Custom folders are now stored in the database, not localStorage
- Folders persist across browser sessions, devices, and app updates
- Each user has their own set of custom folders

### User Experience
- Seamless integration with existing default categories
- Visual distinction between default and custom folders
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Real-time updates when folders are added/deleted

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints ensure data consistency
- Row Level Security (RLS) protects user data
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate folder names per user

## Migration from localStorage

If you have existing users with custom folders in localStorage, you can create a migration script to:

1. Read the `saveit_categories` from localStorage
2. Filter out default categories (Coding, Study, Personal, Work)
3. Create database records for the remaining custom folders
4. Clear the localStorage data

## Benefits

1. **Persistence** - Folders no longer disappear after page refreshes or browser restarts
2. **Cross-device sync** - Folders are available on all devices
3. **Data safety** - Database backup and recovery for folder data
4. **Scalability** - Can handle unlimited custom folders per user
5. **User control** - Users can only delete their own custom folders

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the custom folder system:

1. **Folder icons** - Allow users to select custom icons for folders
2. **Folder colors** - Custom color selection for better organization
3. **Folder sharing** - Share folders between users
4. **Folder templates** - Pre-defined folder structures
5. **Folder hierarchy** - Nested folders for better organization
6. **Folder export/import** - Backup and restore folder structures
